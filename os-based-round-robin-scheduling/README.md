# RTX Multitasking with Round-Robin Scheduling

This project implements multitasking on the ARM Cortex-M3 using the Keil RTX real-time operating system.  
It demonstrates round-robin scheduling between multiple threads and system-level task management.

## Project Versions
- **Three-Task Round-Robin:** Demonstrates thread switching between three tasks using equal time slices.  
- **OS-Based Round-Robin Scheduling:** Simulates a mini operating system managing memory, CPU, and device tasks.

## Key Topics
- Thread creation and scheduling using RTX  
- System tick timer configuration  
- Event Viewer and Performance Analyzer usage  
- Real-time thread switching and execution profiling

## Learning Highlights
- Built multithreaded applications using CMSIS-RTOS APIs  
- Visualized round-robin behavior using the Event Viewer  
- Analyzed CPU utilization and thread performance metrics
