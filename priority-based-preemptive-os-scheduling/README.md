## Key Topics
- Preemptive vs. round-robin scheduling  
- Thread priority management  
- osThreadYield() and osDelay() usage  
- CPU utilization and idle thread behavior

## Learning Highlights
- Implemented thread prioritization for preemptive scheduling  
- Observed execution timing using the Event Viewer and Performance Analyzer  
- Compared round-robin and preemptive scheduling efficiency
